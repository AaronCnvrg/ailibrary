---
The metrics which the algorithm returns are:

```model``` - The name of the output model file.

```folds``` - The number of folds used in the cross validation (if demanded by the user).

```train_acc``` - float in (0, 1). 

```train_loss_mean_squared``` - error calculated by mean_squared_error.

```train_loss_mean_absolute``` - error calculated by mean_absolute_error.

```train_loss_rmse``` - error calculated by root mean squared error.

```test_acc``` - float in (0, 1).

```test_loss_mean_squared``` - error calculated by mean_squared_error.

```test_loss_mean_absolute``` - error calculated by mean_absolute_error.

```test_loss_rmse``` - error calculated by root mean squared error.
